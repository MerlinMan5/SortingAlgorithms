CSCE 221 - Programming Assignment 2


The point of this is GitHub stuff is to be able for all of us to be able to accsess and edit each source file. Like a Google Docs for code. But the difference is that whenver someone wants to edit code, Git makes a coy of it, the user can edit and then add it to the original (so if you ruin the cod, its just a copy so no biggie). GitHub is used everywhere so its high time we figuerd out how to use it, there are actually 4 differetn ways to use Git, that I have found.

Website only: The website itself allows us to put files on it and people could look at the public files and download or copy paste them into their own text editor/IDE

Git Desktop: Automatically acsess, edit, and reupload using a Text Editor only (at least I couldtn figure out how to get it to work with Visual Studio

Command Line: This looks really hard and complicated so just dont even

Visual Studio Git Integration: The best way I have found! This allows users to download the files from visual studio, edit them in visual studio, then upload then, all in Visual Studio! I figuerd out how to do this after watcing this 12 min vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ijfypw7qJgg
